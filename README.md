# My first React Native app!

On the home screen you have 2 option, to make a todo list or to share a photo, this is a bit random and does not make sense as a "whole" app but this is just made in a learning purpose, I started my creating the todo list and the wanted to make some navigation to go between screens and I saw this cool feature about sharing a photo so I just threw it in there as well.

The navigation is a stack navigation where you can go back and the "my app" home screen is the default screen.

Try out the todo list, write a todo and delete it, then you get up an alert if you are sure to delete. Try to add an empty field, then you get another alert.

Share a photo from your camera roll ( allow permission ) and try to share the photo to your friend on messenger.

I really enjoyed diving into React Native and wanted to try out many more features but I need to get going and focus on my next school project :)

I used the EXPO app to view the app while building it both on the Simulator in XCODE on my Mac and on my iPhone.

### The folder organisation:

- **components** - the "add Todo" component and the "todo item" component that I used in the "TodoList.js" ( screen folder )

- **screens** - the screens you can navigate between in the app ( files that keeps them ain code for each screen )

- **routes** - the navigation set up using Stack Navigation

- **styles** - global style file for styles that is used in more then one places
